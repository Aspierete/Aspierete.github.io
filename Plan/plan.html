            <p> I struggled with little anxiety for the last couple of days. I'm back on track yet, not quite my tempo. Let's wrap up </p>  
            <p> <u> Graphics Programming Study </u> </p>

            Well... It's been a week, and I did nothing I planned. Although I didn't do anything I planned, I bought a new laptop mostly for programming. Thus, I spent an entire day installing Pop!_OS and other stuff that I'll need. I also got distracted by things that aren't in my control. I discovered an academic on YouTube who shares his lessons about graphics programming. It's not for OpenGL, but I still believe it would be useful to grasp the fundamentals of graphics programming.
          </p>
          <p> I also had a meeting with an artist for my video game project. It's been a while since I contacted them, so it feels good to be back on track. </p>

          <p> I didn't finish before sleep but finisehd it when i woke up. I'm spending most of my times by playing Valheim with my couple of friends and about to finish the game. It's very fun. I consider to write a game design article about it.  I mostly satisfied about my website. I do believe now I can go back to work. </p>
            <ul> 
              <li>- I want to write a devlog post about the game i'm currently working on. </li>
              <li>- I should edit devlog page. (It will be easy just a copy-paste from graphics programming page. </li>
            </ul>

          <p> I finished most of the work for the website. My goal was to increase my productivity, generate motivation and create a wiki for myself but I think spent more time than I should have to design it. From now on I'll be constantly updating this page. I want to finish the website asap so I can go back to my stuff. It's a bit late - a monster mango loco or redbull blue berry would be awesome- but It'd be great if I could do: </p>
            <ul> 
              <li>* edit contact page </li>
              <li>* Remake about page </li>
