              <p> Hello, hitchhiker of the internet! Welcome to my website. </p>
              <p> I am an indie game developer who is interested in system design and production. Lately, I've been diving into graphics programming and am currently learning OpenGL. <br> I’m also working on creating a game development collective for individuals who are unemployed, hobbyists looking to monetize their games, or those who want to avoid corporate jobs and pursue the indie game development adventure. <br> In addition, I'm building an online hackerspace focused mainly on, but not limited to, game development technologies. On this site, I’ll be sharing my experiences on these journeys.</p>
              <p> I hope you enjoy exploring my website. Have a great day! </p>
